# Community Hub

This directory documents how we gather feedback, share learnings, and celebrate adoption stories. Contribute updates whenever you run office hours, complete reviews, or deploy metrics in the field.

## How to Participate
- **Share an adoption story** in `adoption_stories.md` to highlight real-world impact and lessons.
- **Add meeting notes** from office hours, review boards, or workshops in `meeting_notes.md`.
- **Log feedback** received through the intake form or surveys in `feedback_log.md`.
- **Update the changelog** after major merges, remediation milestones, or governance decisions.

We publish quarterly community updates summarizing highlights, open questions, and upcoming events. Reach out via the feedback intake process below.

## Feedback Intake
1. Complete the [Feedback Form](https://example.com/meaningful-metrics-feedback) or email `feedback@meaningfulmetrics.org`.
2. Maintainers triage submissions weekly, log them in `feedback_log.md`, and assign owners in the decision log.
3. Responses and remediation progress are tracked publicly in `changelog.md`.

## Office Hours
- Hosted on the first Thursday of each month at 17:00 UTC.
- Agenda: new proposals, blockers, community requests, spotlight adoption stories.
- Notes and follow-ups belong in `meeting_notes.md`.
