# Engaged Learning Time

## Summary
Encourages learning platforms to promote focused, purposeful study sessions that result in real skill growth and avoid unstructured binge consumption.

## Context & Motivation
Learners often spend hours consuming educational videos or articles without clear retention or follow-through. Traditional watch-time metrics reward platforms for maximizing time-on-site, even if the learner is distracted. Engaged Learning Time reframes success as sustained attention coupled with measurable understanding and reflective breaks.

## Desired Behaviors
- Learners select content aligned with current learning goals.
- Sessions include active checkpoints (quizzes, projects, reflections) that demonstrate comprehension.
- Platforms encourage restorative pauses after intense study blocks rather than autoplaying endless content.

## Measurement Strategy
- **Signals:**
  - Time spent on goal-aligned content (tagged by user goals or learning plan).
  - Completion of interactive checkpoints (quizzes, practice problems, peer feedback).
  - Reflection events (journaling prompts, goal reviews) within 24 hours of a session.
- **Calculation:**
  1. Aggregate session time where at least one checkpoint is completed.
  2. Multiply by a comprehension factor (e.g., quiz score, peer review rating) scaled 0–1.
  3. Apply a taper that reduces additional credit after 90 minutes of continuous study without a 10-minute break.
- **Frequency:** Compute weekly per learner and monitor cohort-level trends.

## Implementation Considerations
- Requires reliable goal tagging for content and opt-in goal selection from learners.
- Checkpoint quality should be periodically audited to ensure they measure meaningful progress.
- Platforms must respect user privacy when logging reflections—store anonymized signals when possible.

## Validation & Feedback
- Compare Engaged Learning Time with independent assessments of skill acquisition.
- Run learner interviews to confirm the metric matches perceived progress and avoids burnout.
- Monitor for regressions where the metric rises but completion satisfaction scores fall.

## Ethical Checklist
- Provides agency by letting learners set or update goals at any time.
- Includes tapering to discourage harmful cramming or late-night binges.
- Surfaces potential equity gaps by analyzing outcomes across demographic segments.
