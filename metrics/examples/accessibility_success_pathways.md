# Accessibility Success Pathways

**Maturity:** Idea  \
**Domain:** Accessibility features within learning and productivity platforms

## Intent
Ensure disabled learners can complete critical workflows with assistive technologies by measuring the share of sessions that successfully transition through an accessible flow from onboarding to task completion.

## Signals
- Count of sessions where users enable an accessibility setting and subsequently complete the targeted workflow (e.g., submitting an assignment, exporting a project).
- Time to task completion compared to baseline flows, sliced by assistive technology type.
- Frequency and severity of accessibility-related support tickets raised during or after the flow.
- Optional qualitative check-ins capturing user satisfaction with the accessible experience.

## Incentives
- Encourages teams to treat accessibility journeys as first-class product surfaces with instrumentation, QA, and support parity.
- Drives investment in proactive accessibility QA and co-design with disabled experts.
- Highlights the importance of graceful fallback paths and documentation for assistive technologies.

## Guardrails
- Require parity such that completion time for accessible flows is no more than 15% longer than the standard experience absent a documented rationale.
- Trigger an engineering escalation when support ticket rates exceed 5% of assisted sessions over a rolling 30-day window.
- Maintain an "accessibility debt" register for known issues, tied to remediation SLAs tracked in the governance toolkit.

## Validation
- Run moderated usability studies with participants representing assistive technology diversity (screen readers, switch devices, voice control) at least twice annually.
- Pair quantitative metrics with qualitative satisfaction surveys scored on a 5-point scale; success requires an average score above 4.0 with no protected group below 3.5.
- Reference the instrumentation workbook in [`tooling/metrics/accessibility_success_pathways`](../../tooling/metrics/accessibility_success_pathways/) to monitor regressions across releases.

## Implementation Notes
- Instrument events for `accessibility_mode_enabled`, `flow_entry`, `flow_checkpoint`, `flow_success`, and `support_ticket_created`, ensuring metadata captures assistive tech type and blockers encountered.
- Establish cross-functional runbooks so support teams can rapidly route accessibility bugs and document remediation progress in the decision log template.
