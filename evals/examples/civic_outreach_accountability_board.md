# Civic Outreach Accountability Board

**Maturity:** Idea  \
**Applies to:** Municipal or civic organizations deploying AI to target outreach campaigns, eligibility notices, or public service reminders.

## Mission Alignment
Provide democratic oversight for AI-driven outreach so automated messaging expands access to services without reinforcing historical inequities or eroding public trust.

## Evaluation Objectives
1. Audit outreach targeting models for fairness across race, income, language, disability, and geography.
2. Ensure campaign content is transparent, accessible, and aligned with community-approved narratives.
3. Verify that feedback mechanisms are responsive and remediation actions are logged publicly.

## Key Checks
- **Bias & Reach Analysis:** Quarterly review of impression and action rates using the SQL notebook in [`tooling/evals/civic_outreach_accountability_board`](../../tooling/evals/civic_outreach_accountability_board/) to detect disparities >10 percentage points.
- **Message Transparency Review:** Community board verifies that outreach messages disclose AI usage, data sources, and opt-out choices in plain language across all supported languages.
- **Public Feedback Loop:** Track submissions from the open feedback form; require responses within 10 business days and document remediation in the community changelog.
- **Incident Simulation:** Twice-yearly tabletop exercise rehearsing mis-targeting scenarios (e.g., false eligibility alerts) and verifying escalation paths.

## Instrumentation
- Maintain datasets capturing predicted eligibility, outreach delivery, engagement outcomes, and demographic slices sourced from public equity data.
- Log community feedback tickets with fields for severity, impacted groups, and resolution dates to integrate with the governance toolkit.

## Governance Rituals
- Board composed of city staff, community-based organizations, and resident representatives meets bi-monthly; minutes published to [`community/meeting_notes.md`](../../community/meeting_notes.md).
- Annual public report summarizing outreach performance, mitigations, and upcoming audits.
- Require sign-off from the board chair and city equity office before deploying new targeting models or major content changes.

## Exit Criteria for Launch
- No outstanding high-severity fairness gaps; medium-severity gaps have funded remediation plans with clear owners.
- Transparency checklist fully satisfied in all supported languages, with readability scores at or below an 8th-grade level.
- Feedback response SLA met for the previous two quarters, with evidence logged in the decision log template.
- Incident simulation action items completed and verified by the board.
