  SELECT
    recommendation_id,
    user_id,
    goal_context,
    MIN(event_timestamp) AS rendered_at
  FROM recommendation_events
  WHERE event_name = 'recommendation_rendered'
    AND event_timestamp BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
  GROUP BY 1,2,3
),
completions AS (

    MIN(event_timestamp) AS completed_at
  FROM recommendation_events
  WHERE event_name = 'recommendation_completed'
    AND event_timestamp BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
  GROUP BY 1,2
)
SELECT
  i.goal_context,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN c.completed_at IS NOT NULL AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.completed_at - i.rendered_at)) <= 604800 THEN i.recommendation_id END) * 1.0 /
  NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT i.recommendation_id), 0) AS actionable_recommendation_rate

## Operational Checklist
- Ensure the goal context taxonomy is co-designed with user research and localized teams.
- Run the fairness audit notebook monthly to confirm no protected segment has an actionable rate <80% of the top-performing group.
- Review qualitative feedback for the top negative themes and log remediation actions in the decision log template.
