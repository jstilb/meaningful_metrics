## Monitoring Workbook
- Use the provided CSV template `accessibility_pathway_fairness_template.csv` to track completion rate parity across assistive technology types.
- Refresh dashboards weekly to monitor completion time deltas between assisted and baseline flows.

## Alerts
- Configure an alert when the ratio `assisted_completion_rate / baseline_completion_rate` drops below 0.85 for any segment.
- Trigger a PagerDuty incident when more than five high-severity support tickets are filed within a rolling 7-day period.

## Remediation Log
Document all issues and fixes using the decision log template in `docs/toolkit/decision_log_template.md`, referencing the ticket IDs and affected flows.
