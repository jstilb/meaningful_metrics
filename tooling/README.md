# Tooling Quick Starts

This directory pairs each exemplar with actionable assets so teams can instrument events, run analyses, and operationalize governance rituals quickly. Every subdirectory includes:

- **Instrumentation Guides** that describe required events, schemas, and logging standards.
- **Reference Queries or Notebooks** to calculate key indicators and fairness slices.
- **Operational Checklists** that connect metrics and evaluations to review cadences and remediation workflows.

Adapt these assets to your stack while preserving the human-centered intent of each metric or evaluation.
