# Validation & Governance Toolkit

Use these reusable assets to support consistent evaluation quality across metrics and AI playbooks. Each template is designed to pair with the contribution maturity tiers defined in the README.

- `fairness_audit_checklist.md` — Structured questions for identifying and mitigating bias.
- `participant_survey_template.md` — Standardized survey for measuring perceived impact and trust.
- `decision_log_template.md` — Shared format for capturing review outcomes, commitments, and follow-up tasks.
- `accessibility_debt_register.csv` — Tracker for outstanding accessibility issues and remediation SLAs.

Contributors should copy these assets into their internal documentation, customize responsibly, and link back to updates in the community changelog.
